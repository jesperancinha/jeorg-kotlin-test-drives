3. Leverage Kotlin's scope functions for more concise code
4. Use collection operations and functional programming features
5. Add proper comments for better organization
6. Follow consistent formatting and style
7. Use proper null safety features
8. Consider using data classes for simple data containers
9. Use extension functions appropriately
