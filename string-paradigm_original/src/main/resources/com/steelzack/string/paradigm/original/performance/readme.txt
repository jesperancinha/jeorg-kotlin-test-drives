This code in it's original form loads a bunch of strings into a controller.
However it consumes too much memory
The idea is to provide the best possible solution for the problem starting from simple approach solutions and then moving on to better solutions
It should go through different phases:
string-paradigms_1
(...)
string-paradigms_n

where n is the most optimal solution for time being.
